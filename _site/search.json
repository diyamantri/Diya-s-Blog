    "text": "Team-3: Diya Mantri, Arya Mohan, Gayatri Jadhav, Rithika Amireddi, Tanmayee M\n\n\n\nOur custom-trained model plays the perfect Chitta Swarams when it detects traditional Indian mudras. Just make a mudra to your camera, and it will recognize it and start singing the Raaga!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code is only functional in a local environment when VSCode is used in conjunction with the Live Server extension. The following is just to show the functionality of the code.\n\n\n\n\n\nMudra Model Project Flow\n\n\nDataset Creation\n\nCollected hand pose images showing different mudras using both left and right hands.\nExtracted 21 hand keypoints per image (x, y coordinates) using a hand-tracking model.\nStored data in a CSV format: 42 columns for keypoints + 1 column for output label (Mudra_Hand format, e.g., Mayura_L).\n\n\nCode for File Path Nomenclature\nThis Python script converts randomly named files into sequentially organized and correctly labeled files.\n\n\n\nClick to view the Python script\n\nimport os\n\ndef rename_with_fixed_prefix(folder_path, prefix=\"T3M1R\"):\n    \"\"\"\n    Renames all image files sequentially with fixed prefix and incrementing 3-digit number.\n\n    Args:\n        folder_path (str): Path to the folder containing images\n        prefix (str): Fixed prefix for filenames (default: \"T3M2L\")\n    \"\"\"\n    # Get all image files with common extensions\n    image_extensions = ('.png', '.jpg', '.jpeg', '.gif', '.bmp', '.tiff', '.webp')\n    image_files = [f for f in os.listdir(folder_path) \n                 if f.lower().endswith(image_extensions)]\n\n    # Sort files by creation time (oldest first)\n    image_files.sort(key=lambda f: os.path.getctime(os.path.join(folder_path, f)))\n\n    # Rename files sequentially\n    for index, filename in enumerate(image_files, start=1):\n        # Get file extension\n        ext = os.path.splitext(filename)[1].lower()\n\n        # Create new filename with fixed prefix and 3-digit number\n        new_name = f\"{prefix}{index:03d}{ext}\"\n        new_path = os.path.join(folder_path, new_name)\n\n        # Handle name conflicts by finding next available number\n        while os.path.exists(new_path):\n            index += 1\n            new_name = f\"{prefix}{index:03d}{ext}\"\n            new_path = os.path.join(folder_path, new_name)\n\n        # Rename the file\n        old_path = os.path.join(folder_path, filename)\n        os.rename(old_path, new_path)\n        print(f\"Renamed: {filename} -&gt; {new_name}\")\n\n\nrename_with_fixed_prefix(r\"C:\\Users\\ASUS\\Desktop\\Main\\Srishti\\Sem 6\\Mathematical Experiments with Code\\A2_Mudra_Detection\\Nomenclature_Code\\Mudras\\Arala\\Right\", \"T3M1R\")\n\n\nLink to Dataset Creation Code for File Path List Generation\nThis Python script creates a JSON file that simply lists the names of the images in the folder, so easing the processing burden on the JavaScript file by removing the necessity to navigate the image directory.\n\n\n\nClick to view the Python script\n\nimport os\nimport json\n\nimage_folder = r'C:\\Users\\ASUS\\Desktop\\Main\\Srishti\\Sem 6\\Mathematical Experiments with Code\\A2_Mudra_Detection\\Nomenclature_Code\\new-images'\n\nfilenames = [f for f in os.listdir(image_folder) if f.lower().endswith(('.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png'))]\nfilenames.sort()\n\noutput_path = os.path.join(image_folder, 'fileList.json')\n\nwith open(output_path, 'w') as f:\n    json.dump(filenames, f, indent=2)\n\nprint(f'fileList.json generated with {len(filenames)} files.')\n\n\nLink to Dataset Creation Code\nThe code is only functional in a local environment when VSCode is used in conjunction with the Live Server extension. The following is just to show the functionality of the code.\n\n\n\n\n\nData Validation\n\nChecked for missing or inaccurately plotted keypoints.\nEnsured correct label formatting and consistency across rows.\nIdentified class imbalance (e.g., fewer samples of katakamukha) and to fixed it.\nRan data through ChatGPT for quality feedback.\n\n\n\nModel Training\n\nUsed the formatted CSV to train a neural network model.\nMonitored loss values to track model learning.\nSaved trained models as .json and .bin files.\n\n\n\nModel Testing\n\nTested the model with new hand keypoint data to verify predictions.\nObserved inconsistencies across browsers (e.g., the model worked on Firefox but not Chrome).\nDiscovered potential issues with model file parsing and incorrect predictions.\n\n\n\nDebugging Phase\n\nIdentified possible causes like:\n\nInvalid or corrupted weight files\nIncorrect CSV formatting (e.g., confusion between one output column vs. two)\nHeavy or skipped images during preprocessing\n\nNoted that katakamukha images may have been bypassed due to tracking failures.\n\n\n\nNext Steps\n\nDebugged the image-to-CSV converter script to ensure no images are skipped.\nFinalised the prediction algorithm and integrated it with Chitta Swarams for real-time interaction."
