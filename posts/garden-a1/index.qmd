This animation is an interpretation of nature’s change, illustrating the process from turmoil to peaceful renewal. With dynamic elements like clouds, rain, lightning, to ultimately sunshine, flowers, and fluttering butterflies, the work represents the strength and beauty of nature in transition.

It is a metaphor for turmoil and calm, derived from changing seasons. It talks about destruction and rebirth and restates the idea of rebirth even during the most darkest storms. Its shift in ambience from storm and rain to bright sunshine makes one feel calm, cheerful, and hopeful.
