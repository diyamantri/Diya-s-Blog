<p>Our custom-trained model plays the perfect Chitta Swarams when it detects traditional Indian mudras. Just make a mudra to your camera, and it will recognize it and start singing the Raaga!</p>

<p>**Mudra Model Project Flow**</p>

<p>

**Dataset Creation**

-   Collected hand pose images showing different mudras using both left and right hands.

-   Extracted 21 hand keypoints per image (x, y coordinates) using a hand-tracking model.

-   Stored data in a CSV format: 42 columns for keypoints + 1 column for output label (Mudra_Hand format, e.g., Mayura_L).

    </p>

    <p>**Code for File Path Nomenclature**

    This Python script converts randomly named files into sequentially organized and correctly labeled files.

    <p>**Link to Dataset Creation Code for File Path List Generation**

    This Python script creates a JSON file that simply lists the names of the images in the folder, so easing the processing burden on the JavaScript file by removing the necessity to navigate the image directory.

    ``` python

    filenames = [f for f in os.listdir(image_folder) if f.lower().endswith(('.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png'))]

**Data Validation**

-   Checked for missing or inaccurately plotted keypoints.

-   Ensured correct label formatting and consistency across rows.

-   Identified class imbalance (e.g., fewer samples of katakamukha) and to fixed it.

-   Ran data through ChatGPT for quality feedback.

</p>

<p>

**Model Training**

-   Used the formatted CSV to train a neural network model.

-   Monitored loss values to track model learning.

-   Saved trained models as .json and .bin files.

</p>

<p>

**Model Testing**

-   Tested the model with new hand keypoint data to verify predictions.

-   Observed inconsistencies across browsers (e.g., the model worked on Firefox but not Chrome).

-   Discovered potential issues with model file parsing and incorrect predictions.

</p>

<p>

**Debugging Phase**

-   Identified possible causes like:

    -   Invalid or corrupted weight files

    -   Incorrect CSV formatting (e.g., confusion between one output column vs. two)

    -   Heavy or skipped images during preprocessing

-   Noted that katakamukha images may have been bypassed due to tracking failures.

</p>

<p>

**Next Steps**

-   Debugged the image-to-CSV converter script to ensure no images are skipped.

-   Finalised the prediction algorithm and integrated it with Chitta Swarams for real-time interaction.
